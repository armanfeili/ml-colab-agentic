# Step-by-Step: Push to GitHub

## Prerequisites
1. You've created a new repository on GitHub at:
   https://github.com/armanfeili/ml-colab-agentic
   
   (DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license - leave it empty)

## Commands to Run

```bash
cd "/Users/armanfeili/code/New Projects/ml-colab-agentic"

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/armanfeili/ml-colab-agentic.git

# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## After Pushing

1. **Mark as Template** (in GitHub Web UI)
   - Go to: https://github.com/armanfeili/ml-colab-agentic/settings
   - Scroll to "Repository template" section
   - Check: ✓ "Template repository"
   - This lets others use it as a template for new projects

2. **Add Repository Topics** (optional but recommended)
   - Go to: https://github.com/armanfeili/ml-colab-agentic
   - Click "About" (gear icon) on the right
   - Add topics: `template`, `colab`, `gpu`, `ml`, `copilot`, `agentic`, `jupyter`
   - Save

3. **Enable Branch Protection** (recommended)
   - Settings → Branches → Add rule
   - Branch name pattern: `main`
   - ✓ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✓ Require status checks to pass (select `run-notebook.yml`)
   - ✓ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed

4. **Verify Colab Badge Works**
   - Click the Colab badge in the README
   - It should open your notebook directly in Colab
