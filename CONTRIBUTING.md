# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started:

1. **Fork & branch** from `main`.
2. **Keep changes small and focused** — one feature or fix per PR.
3. **Run linting and tests** before submitting:
   ```bash
   ruff check .
   pytest -q
   ```
4. **Open a PR** with a clear summary and checklist.

## Code standards

- Python code must pass `ruff` linting and `black` formatting.
- All new features should have corresponding tests in `tests/`.
- Notebook cells should be concise and well-documented.
